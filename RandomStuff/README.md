### Projects Overview

Below is a selection of projects I have developed, showcasing my skills in web development, game design, and artificial intelligence.

#### 1. Boids Simulation
- **Description**: Developed a flocking simulation based on the principles of Separation, Cohesion, and Alignment. Each boid has a distinct face, adding a unique visual element to the simulation.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Implementation of flocking algorithms, visual representation of individual boids.

#### 2. LegalWebsite
- **Description**: Created a website to explain various legal laws as part of a 6th form project. This was my first comprehensive web development project, and it provided a strong foundation in web technologies.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Informative content presentation, user-friendly interface.

#### 3. Genetic AI
- **Description**: Designed a project to understand and implement a genetic algorithm. This project served as an introduction to machine learning concepts and genetic algorithms.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Basic implementation of genetic algorithms, visualization of AI learning process.

#### 4. Snake Game
- **Description**: Recreated the classic snake game within four hours, without relying on any guides or tutorials. This project demonstrates my ability to rapidly develop functional games from scratch.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Classic gameplay mechanics, responsive design.

#### 5. Tic Tac Toe
- **Description**: Developed a web-based tic-tac-toe game where players can compete against a simple AI that makes random moves. This project highlights my understanding of game logic and AI behavior.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Basic AI opponent, interactive user interface.
