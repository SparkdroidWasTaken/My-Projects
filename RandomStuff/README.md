# Random stuff
just a bunch of random projects I have made throughout the years. I'll also add a list here so you have an idea of the projects here.
1) Boids - A flocking simulation I made which follow the 3 rules, Separation, Corhesion and Alignment. they also have faces because yes.
2) LegalWebsite - Had to make a website explaining a few of the legal laws at 6th form so I decided to have fun with it. This was also my first actual attempt at web development and I think i did pretty well.
3) Genetic AI - started getting into machine learning and made this to learn about how a genetic algorithm works. It's pretty simple but I found it really fun to make
